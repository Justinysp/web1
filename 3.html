<h2>JavaScript</h2>

<p> JavaScript is incorporated in a wide variety of Web and desktop applications
   that you use every day. It is used in many online games and chat rooms,
   as well as in many business applications.
   Every so often Sun Microsystems, the creator of JavaScript, will release an updated version of JavaScript.
    The updates are free and can be downloaded directly from the Java website. </p>
